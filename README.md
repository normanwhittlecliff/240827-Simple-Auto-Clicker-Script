# Simple Auto Clicker Script

A super simple Auto Clicker Script I wrote in python on *August 27, 2024*.

Run it, press "P" on your keyboard to toggle it on/off and have at it. Since it is simple, there is no sound or image notifying that it is on. Be careful with it.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3**: I assume you already have it in your computer, but yeah, this one is needed to run the script.
- **Pynpuy**: The *Pynput* library, which you need to *install* in your computer and you can do that by opening your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) and enter the following command:
  > pip install pynput
